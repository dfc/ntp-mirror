This document describes the format of an NTP symmetric key file.
For a description of the use of this type of file, see the
.Qq
Authentication
Support
section of the
@code{ntp.conf(5)}
page.

@code{ntpd(8)}
reads its keys from a file specified using the
@code{-k} command line option or the
.Ic
keys
statement in the configuration file.
While key number 0 is fixed by the NTP standard
(as 56 zero bits)
and may not be changed,
one or more keys numbered between 1 and 65534
may be arbitrarily set in the keys file.

The key file uses the same comment conventions
as the configuration file.
Key entries use a fixed format of the form

.D1
Ar
keyno
type
key

where
.Ar
keyno
is a positive integer (between 1 and 65534),
.Ar
type
is the message digest algorithm,
and
.Ar
key
is the key itself.

The
.Ar
key
may be given in a format
controlled by the
.Ar
type
field.
The
.Ar
type
.Li
MD5
is always supported.
If
.Li
ntpd
was built with the OpenSSL library
then any digest library supported by that library may be specified.
However, if compliance with FIPS 140-2 is required the
.Ar
type
must be either
.Li
SHA
or
.Li
SHA1
.

What follows are some key types, and corresponding formats:

@table @samp
@item Li
The key is 1 to 16 printable characters terminated by
an EOL,
whitespace,
or
a
.Li
#
(which is the "start of comment" character).

@item Li
@item Li
@item Li
The key is a hex-encoded ASCII string of 40 characters,
which is truncated as necessary.

@end multitable

Note that the keys used by the
@code{ntpq(8)}
and
@code{ntpdc(8)}
programs are checked against passwords
requested by the programs and entered by hand,
so it is generally appropriate to specify these keys in ASCII format.

@node ntp.keys usage
@subsection ntp.keys help/usage (@option{--help})
@cindex ntp.keys help

This is the automatically generated usage text for ntp.keys.

The text printed is the same whether selected with the @code{help} option
(@option{--help}) or the @code{more-help} option (@option{--more-help}).  @code{more-help} will print
the usage text by passing it through a pager program.
@code{more-help} is disabled on platforms without a working
@code{fork(2)} function.  The @code{PAGER} environment variable is
used to select the program, defaulting to @file{more}.  Both will exit
with a status code of 0.

@node ntp.keys config
@subsection presetting/configuring ntp.keys

Any option that is not marked as @i{not presettable} may be preset by
loading values from environment variables named @code{NTP.KEYS} and @code{NTP.KEYS_<OPTION_NAME>}.  @code{<OPTION_NAME>} must be one of
the options listed above in upper case and segmented with underscores.
The @code{NTP.KEYS} variable will be tokenized and parsed like
the command line.  The remaining variables are tested for existence and their
values are treated like option arguments.


The command line options relating to configuration and/or usage help are:

@subsubheading version

Print the program version to standard out, optionally with licensing
information, then exit 0.  The optional argument specifies how much licensing
detail to provide.  The default is to print just the version.  The licensing infomation may be selected with an option argument.  Only the
first letter of the argument is examined:

@table @samp
@item version
Only print the version.  This is the default.
@item copyright
Name the copyright usage licensing terms.
@item verbose
Print the full copyright usage licensing terms.
@end table

@node ntp.keys exit status
@subsection ntp.keys exit status

One of the following exit values will be returned:
@table @samp
@item 0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)
Successful program execution.
@item 1 (EXIT_FAILURE)
The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
@end table
@node ntp.keys Files
@subsection ntp.keys Files
@table @samp
@item Pa
the default name of the configuration file
