<h4 id="intro">Introduction</h4>
<p>This distribution includes support for the  Autokey public key algorithms and protocol specified in RFC-5906 &quot;Network Time Protocol Version 4: Autokey Specification&quot;. This support is available only if the OpenSSL library has been installed and the <tt>--enable-autokey</tt> option   is specified when the distribution is built.</p>
<p> Public key cryptography is generally considered more secure than symmetric key cryptography. Symmetic key cryptography is based on a shared secret key which must be distributed by secure means to all participats. Public key cryptography is based on a private secret key known only to the originator and a public key known to all participants. A recipient can verify the originator has the correct private key using the public key and any of several digital signature algortihms.</p>
<p>The Autokey Version 2 protocol described on the <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/%7emills/proto.html">Autokey Protocol</a> page verifies packet integrity using  message digest algorithms, such as MD5 or SHA,  and verifies the source using  any of several digital signature schemes, such as RSA or DSA.  As used in Autokey, message digests are exceptionlly difficult to cryptanalyze, as the keys are used only once.</p>
<p> Optional identity schemes described on the <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ident.html">Autokey Identity Schemes</a> page are based on cryptographic challenge/response exchanges.  Identity schemes provide strong security against  masquerade and most forms of clogging attacks. These schemes are exceptionally difficulat to cryptanalyze, as the challenge/response exchange data are used only once. They  are described along with an executive summary, current status, briefing slides and reading list on the <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/autokey.html">Autonomous Authentication</a> page.</p>
<p>Autokey authenticates individual packets using cookies bound to the IP source and destination addresses. The cookies must have the same IP addresses at both the server and client. For this reason operation with network address translation schemes is not possible. This reflects the intended robust security model where government and corporate NTP servers and clients are operated outside firewall perimeters.</p>
<p>Auokey is designed to authenticate servers to clients, not the other way around as in SSH.  An Autokey server can support an authentication scheme such as the Trusted Certificate (TC) scheme described in RFC 5905, whle a client is free to choose between the various options. It is important to understand that these provisions are optional and that selection of which option is at the discretion of the client. If the client does not require authentication, it is free to ignore it, even if some other client of the same server elects to participate in either symmetric key or public key cryptography.</p>
<p> Autokey uses industry standard X.509 public certificates, which can be produced by commercial services, utility programs in the OpenSSL software library, and the <a href="keygen.html"><tt>ntp-keygen</tt></a> utility program in the NTP software distribution.  A certificate includes the subject name of the client, the issuer name of the server, the public key of the server and the time  period over which the the server public and private keys are valid.   All Autokey hosts have  a self-signed certificate with   the  Autokey name as both the subject and issuer. During the protocol, additional certificates are produced with the Autokey host name as subject and the host that signs the certificate as issuer.</p>
<p>There are two timeouts associated with the Autokey scheme. The <em>key list timeout</em> is set by the <tt>automax</tt> command, which  specifies the interval between generating new key lists by the client. The default timeout of about 1.1 hr is appropriate for the majority of configurations and ordinarily should not be changed. The <em>revoke timeout</em> is set by the <tt>revoke</tt> command, which  specifies the interval between generating new server private values. It is intended to reduce the vulnerability to cryptanalysis; however,  new values  require the server to encrypt each client cookie separately. The default timeout of about 36 hr is appropriate for most  servers, but might be too short for national time servers.</p>
<h4 id="cert">Autokey Subnets</h4>
<p> An Autokey subnet consists of a collection of hosts configured as an acyclic, directed tree with roots one or more trusted hosts (THs) operating at the lowest stratum of the subnet. The THs are synchronized  directly or indirectly to national time services via trusted means, such as radio, satellite or telephone modem, or an   NTP secure group as described in the next section.. Autokey hosts operate as servers, clients or both at the same time.</p>
<p>A certificate trail is a sequence of certificates, each signed by a host  nearer the THs and terminating at the self-signed certificate of a TH. As the Autokey protocol proceeds,  each client provides its self-signed certificate to a server  nearer  the THs for signature. In order for the signature to succeed, the client certificate valid period  must begin within the valid period  of the server certificate.  If  the server period begins later than the client period, the client certificate has expired; if the client period begins later than the server period, the server certificate has expired.  While the certificate trail authenticates each host on the trail to  the THs, it does not   validate  the time values themselves. Ultimately, this is determined by the NTP on-wire protocool.</p>
<p>The Autokey protocol runs for each association separately. During the protocol the client recursively obtains all the certificates on the trail to a TH, saving each in a cache ordered from most recent to oldest. If an expired certificate is found, it is invalidated and marked for later replacement. As the client certificate itself is not involved in the certificate trail, it can only be declared valid or expired when the server  signs it. </p>
<p>The certificates derived from each association are combined in the cache with duplicates suppressed. If it happens that two different associations contribute certificates to the cache, a certificate on the trail from one association  could expire before any on another trail. In this case the remaining trails  will survive until the expired certificate is replaced. Once saved in the cache, a certificate remains valid until it expires or is replaced by a new one.</p>
<p> It is important to note that the certificate trail is validated only at startup when an association is mobilized. Once validated in this way,  the server remains valid until it  is demobilized, even if  certificates on the trail to the THs expire.</p>
<h4 id="group">NTP Secure Groups</h4>
<p>NTP security groups are an extension of the NTP subnets described in the previous section. They include in addition to certificate trails one or another identity schemes described on the <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ident.html">Autokey Identity Schemes</a> page. NTP secure groups are used to define cryptographic compartments and security
hierarchies. The identity scheme insures that the server is authentic and not masqueraded by an intruder acting as a middleman.</p>
<p> As in NTP subnet, NTP secure groups are configured as an acyclic tree rooted on the THs. The THs are at the lowest stratum of the secure group. All group hosts construct an  unbroken  certificate trail from each host, possibly via intermediate hosts, and ending at a TH. In addition, each group host verifies the server has the secret group key using an identity exchange.</p>
<p> For secure group servers, the string specified by the <tt>-i</tt> option of the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program is the name of the secure group. For secure group servers this name must match the <tt>ident</tt> option
  of the <tt>crypto</tt> command. For secure group clients, this name must match the <tt>ident</tt> option of the <tt>server</tt> command. This name is also used in the identity keys and parameters file names. The file naming conventions are described on
  the <a href="keygen.html">ntp-keygen</a> page.</p>
<p><span class="style1">In the latest Autokey version, the host name and group name are independent of each other and the <tt>host</tt> option of the <tt>crypto</tt> command is deprecated. When compatibility with older versions is required, specify the same name for both the <tt>-s</tt> and <tt>-i</tt> options.</span></p>
<p>The Autokey identity schemes involve a challenge-response exchange where a client generates a nonce and sends to the server. The server performs a mathematical operation involving a second nonce and the secret group key, and sends the result along with a hash to the client. The client performs a another mathematical operation and verifies the result with the hash. Since each exchange involves two nonces, even after repeated observations of many exchanges, an intruder cannot learn the secret group key. It is this quality that allows the secure group key to persist long after the longest period of certificate validity. In the Schnorr IFF scheme considered later on this page, the secret group key is not divulged to the clients, so they cannot conspire to prove identity to other hosts.</p>
<p>As described on the <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ident.html">Autokey Identity Schemes</a> page, there are five identity schemes, three of which - IFF, GQ and MV - require identity files specific to each scheme. There are two types of files for each scheme, an encrypted keys file  and a nonencrypted parameters file, which usually contains a subset of the keys file. In general,   NTP servers operating as certificate  authorities (CAs) use the keys file and clients use the parameters file. The CAs include the THs and those group servers with dependent clients.</p>
<p> Hosts with no dependent clients can retrieve client parameter files from an
  archive or web page. The <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program can export these data using the <tt>-e</tt> option.
  Hosts with dependent clients other than the CA must retrieve copies of the server
  key files using secure means. The <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program can export these data
  using the <tt>-q</tt> option and chosen remote password. In either case the data are installed as a file
  and then renamed using the name given as the first line in the file, but without
the filestamp.</p>
<h4 id="config2">Configuration - Authentication Schemes</h4>
<p>Autokey has an intimidating number of  options, most of which are not necessary in typical scenarios. However, the  Trusted Certificate (TC) scheme is recommended for  national NTP time services, such as those operated by NIST and USNO. Configuration for TC is very simple. For each server, e.g. <tt>time.nist.gov,</tt> as root:</p>
<p><tt># cd /usr/local/etc<br>
  # ntp-keygen -T</tt></p>
<p>This generates an RSA private/public host key file and a self-signed certificate file for  the RSA digital signature algorithm  with  the MD5 message digest algorithm. Include in the <tt>ntp.conf</tt> configuration file something like</p>
<p><tt># disable kernel<br>
  # server 127.127.18.1	minpoll 12 maxpoll 17 # ACTS modem<br>
  # phone atdt913035547785 atddt913034944774<br>
  # crypto<br>
  # driftfile /etc/ntp.drift</tt></p>
<p>Note the first three lines  are specific to the ACTS driver and NIST modem telephone  numbers. The second number will be tried if the first times out. Alternatively, any other reference clock can be used, or even another time server.</p>
<p>For each client, e.g. <tt>grundoon.udel.edu,</tt> as root:</p>
<p><tt># cd /usr/local/etc<br>
  # ntp-keygen</tt></p>
<p>(There is no -<tt>T</tt> option). Include in the <tt>ntp.conf</tt> configuration file something like</p>
<p><tt># server time.nist.gov iburst autokey<br>
  # crypto<br>
  # driftfile /etc/ntp.drift</tt></p>
<p>It is possible to configure clients  of server <tt>grundoon.udel.edu</tt> in the same way with the server line pointing to <tt>grundoon.udel.edu</tt>. Dependent clients  authenticate to <tt>time.nistg.gov</tt> through <tt>grundoon.udel.edu</tt>.</p>
<p>In the above configuration examples, the default Autokey host name is the string  returned by the Unix <tt>gethostname()</tt> library routine. However, this name has nothing to do with the DNS name of the host. The Autokey host name is used as the subject and issuer names on the certificate, as well as the default  password for the encrypted keys files. The  Autokey host name can be changed using the <tt>-s</tt> option of the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program. The default password can be changed using the <tt>-p</tt> option of the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program and the <tt>pw</tt> option of the <tt>crypto</tt> command.</p>
<h4 ident="ident">Configuration - Identity Schemes</h4>
<p> For the simplest identity scheme TC, the server generates host keys, trusted certificate and identity files using an <tt>ntp-keygen </tt> program commadn with options specified in this section, while the clients use the same command with no options. The server  uses the <tt>crypto</tt>  command in the comnfiguration file with options specified in this section, while the clients use the same command with no options. Additonia client options are specified in the <tt>server</tt> command for each association. </p>
<p> It's best to start with a functioning TC configuation and add  commands as necessary. For example, the CA generates an encrypted server keys file using the command</p>
<p><tt>ntp-keygen -I -i <em>group</em></tt>,</p>
<p>  where  <em><tt>group</tt></em> is the group name used by  all hosts in the group.  This and following commands can be combined in a single command. The   nonencrypted client parameters     can be exported using the  command</p>
<p><tt>ntp-keygen -e &gt;<i>file</i></tt>,</p>
<p>where the <tt>-e</tt> option redirects the  client parameters to <em><tt>file</tt></em> via the standard output stream for a mail application or stored locally for later distribution.  In a similar fashion the  encrypted keys file can be exported using the command </p>
<p><tt>ntp-keygen -q <em>passw2</em> &gt;<i>file</i></tt>,</p>
<p>where <em><tt>passwd2</tt></em> is the read password for another host. In either case the file is installed  under the name<tt> </tt>found in the first line of the file, but converted to lower case and without the filestamp</p>
<p>As in the TC scheme, the server includes a <tt>crypto</tt> command in the configuration file with the <tt>ident <em>group</em></tt> option. The crypto command in the  client configuration file is unchanged, but the server command includes the  <tt>ident <em>group</em></tt> option.</p>
<p>In special circumstances the Autokey message digest algorithm can be changed using the <tt>digest</tt> option of the <tt>crypto</tt> command. The  digest algorithm is separate and distinct from the symmetric
  key message digest algorithm.   If compliance with FIPS 140-2 is required,
the algorithm must be ether <tt>SHA</tt> or <tt>SHA1</tt>. The Autokey message digest algorithm must be the same for  all participants in the NTP subnet.</p>
<h4 id="exam">Examples</h4>
<div align="center"> <img src="pic/group.gif" alt="gif"> </div>
<p>Consider a scenario involving three secure groups RED, GREEN and BLUE. RED and BLUE are typical of national laboratories providing certified time to the Internet at large. As shown ion the figure, RED TH mort and BLUE TH macabre run NTP symmetric mode with each other for monitoring or backup. For the purpose of illustration, assume both THs are primary servers. GREEN is typical of a large university providing certified time to the campus community. GREEN TH howland is a broadcast client of both RED and BLUE. BLUE uses the IFF scheme, while both RED and GREEN use the GQ scheme, but with different keys. YELLOW is a client of GREEN and for purposes of illustration a TH for YELLOW.</p>
<p>The BLUE TH macabre uses configuration commands</p>
<p><tt>crypto pw qqsv ident blue</tt><br>
  <tt>peer mort autokey ident red</tt><br>
  <tt>broadcast <i>address</i> autokey</tt></p>
<p>where <tt>qqsv</tt> is the password for macabre files and <i>address</i> is the broadcast address for the local LAN. It generates BLUE files using the commands</p>
<p><tt>ntp-keygen -p qqsv -T -G -i blue</tt><br>
  <tt>ntp-keygen -p qqsv -e &gt;ntpkey_gqpar_blue</tt></p>
<p>The first line generates the host, trusted certificate and private GQ server keys file. The second generates the public GQ client parameters file, which can have any nonconflicting mnemonic name.</p>
<p>The RED TH mort uses configuration commands</p>
<p><tt>crypto pw xxx ident red</tt><br>
  <tt>peer macabre autokey ident blue</tt><br>
  <tt>broadcast <i>address</i> autokey</tt></p>
<p>where <tt>xxx</tt> is the password for mort files. It generates RED files using the commands</p>
<p><tt>ntp-keygen -p xxx -T -I -i red</tt><br>
  <tt>ntp-keygen -p xxx -e &gt;ntpkey_iffpar_red</tt></p>
<p> The GREEN TH howland uses configuration commands</p>
<p><tt>crypto pw yyy ident green</tt><br>
  <tt>broadcastclient ident red blue</tt></p>
<p>where <tt>yyy</tt> is the password for howland files. It generates GREEN files using the commands</p>
<p><tt>ntp-keygen -p yyy -T -G -i green</tt><br>
  <tt>ntp-keygen -p yyy -e &gt;ntpkey_gqpar_green</tt><br>
  <tt>ntp-keygen -p yyy -q zzz &gt;zzz_ntpkey_gqkey_green</tt></p>
<p>The first two lines serve the same purpose as the preceding examples. The
  third line generates a copy of the private GREEN server file for use on another
  server in the same group, say YELLOW, but encrypted with the <tt>zzz</tt> password.</p>
<p>A client of GREEN, for example YELLOW, uses the configuration commands</p>
<p><tt>crypto pw abc</tt><br>
  <tt>server howland autokey ident red</tt></p>
<p>where <tt>abc</tt> is the password for its files. It generates files using the command</p>
<p><tt>ntp-keygen -p abc</tt></p>
<p>The client retrieves the client file for that group from a public archive or web page using nonsecure means. In addition, each server in a group retrieves the private server keys file from the TH of that group, but it is encrypted and so must be sent using secure means. The files are installed in the keys directory with name taken from the first line in the file, but without the filestamp.</p>
<p>Note that if servers of different groups, in this case RED and BLUE, share the same broadcast media, each server must have client files for all groups other than its own, while each client must have client files for all groups. Note also that this scenario is for illustration only and probably would not be wise for practical use, as if one of the TH reference clocks fails, the certificate trail becomes cyclic. In such cases the symmetric path between RED and BLUE, each in a different group, would not be a good idea.</p>
<h4 id="ident2">Identity Schemes and Cryptotypes</h4>
<p>All configurations include a public/private host key pair and matching certificate. Absent an identity scheme, this is a Trusted Certificate (TC) scheme. There are three optional identity schemes, IFF, GQ and MV described on the <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/%7emills/ident.html">Identity Schemes</a> page. With these schemes all servers in the group have encrypted server identity keys, while clients have nonencrypted client identity parameters. The client parameters can be obtained from a trusted agent (TA), usually one of the THs of the lower stratum group. Further information on identity schemes is on the <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ident.html">Autokey Identity Schemes</a> page.</p>
<p>A specific combination of authentication and identity schemes is called a <em>cryptotype</em>, which applies to clients and servers separately. A group can be
  configured using more than one cryptotype combination, although not all combinations
  are interoperable. Note however that some cryptotype combinations may successfully
  intemperate with each other, but may not represent good security practice. The
  server and client cryptotypes are defined by the the following codes.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>NONE</dt>
  <dd>A client or server is type NONE if authentication is not available or not configured. Packets exchanged between client and server have no MAC.</dd>
  <dt>AUTH</dt>
  <dd>A client or server is type AUTH&nbsp;if the <tt>key</tt> option is specified with the <tt>server</tt> configuration command and the client and server keys are compatible. Packets exchanged between clients and servers have a MAC.</dd>
  <dt>PC</dt>
  <dd>A client or server is type PC if the <tt>autokey</tt> option is specified with the <tt>server</tt> configuration command and compatible host key and private certificate files are present. Packets exchanged between clients and servers have a MAC.</dd>
  <dt>TC</dt>
  <dd>A client or server is type TC  if the <tt>autokey</tt> option is specified with the <tt>server</tt> configuration command and compatible host key and public certificate files are present. Packets exchanged between clients and servers have a MAC.</dd>
  <dt>IDENT</dt>
  <dd>A client or server is type IDENT  if the <tt>autokey</tt> option is specified with the <tt>server</tt> configuration command and compatible host key, public certificate and identity scheme files are present. Packets exchanged between clients and servers have a MAC.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The compatible cryptotypes for clients and servers are listed in the following table.</p>

<h4 id="err">Error Codes</h4>
<p>Errors can occur due to mismatched configurations, unexpected protocol restarts, expired certificates and unfriendly people. In most cases the protocol state machine recovers automatically by retransmission, timeout and restart, where necessary. Some errors are due to mismatched keys, digest schemes or identity schemes and must be corrected by installing the correct media and/or correcting the configuration file. One of the most common errors is expired certificates, which must be regenerated and signed at least once per year using the <a href="keygen.html"><tt>ntp-keygen</tt> - generate public and private keys</a> program.</p>
<p>The following error codes are reported via the NTP control and monitoring protocol trap mechanism and to the <tt>cryptostats</tt> monitoring file if configured.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>101 bad field format or length</dt>
  <dd>The packet has invalid version, length or format.</dd>
  <dt>102 bad timestamp</dt>
  <dd>The packet timestamp is the same or older than the most recent received. This could be due to a replay or a server clock time step.</dd>
  <dt>103 bad filestamp</dt>
  <dd>The packet filestamp is the same or older than the most recent received. This could be due to a replay or a key file generation error.</dd>
  <dt>104 bad or missing public key</dt>
  <dd>The public key is missing, has incorrect format or is an unsupported type.</dd>
  <dt>105 unsupported digest type</dt>
  <dd>The server requires an unsupported digest/signature scheme.</dd>
  <dt>106 unsupported identity type</dt>
  <dd>The client or server has requested an identity scheme the other does not support.</dd>
  <dt>107 bad signature length</dt>
  <dd>The signature length does not match the current public key.</dd>
