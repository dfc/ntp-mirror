<h4>NTP Host Architecture and Basic Operation</h4>
<p>The overall organization of the NTP daemon is shown in Figure 1. It is useful in this context to consider the daemon as both a client of downstatum servers and as a server for upstratum clients. It includes a pair of peer/poll processes for each reference clock or remote  server used as a synchronization source. The poll process sends NTP packets at intervals ranging from 8 s to 36 h. The peer process receives NTP packets and runs the on-wire protocol that collects four timestamps: the <em>origin timestamp</em> <em>T</em><sub>1</sub> upon departure of the client request and the <em>receive timestamp</em> <em>T</em><sub>2</sub> upon arrival at the server, the <em>transmit timestamp</em> <em>T</em><sub>3</sub> upon departure of the server reply and the <em>destination timestamp</em> <em>T</em><sub>4</sub> upon arrival at the client. These timestamps are used to calculate the clock offset and roundtrip delay:</p>
<div align="center">
  <p>offset = [(<em>T</em><sub>2</sub> -<em>T</em><sub>1</sub>) + (<em>T</em><sub>3</sub> - <em>T</em><sub>4</sub>)] / 2<br>
    delay = (<em>T</em><sub>4</sub> - <em>T</em><sub>1</sub>) - (<em>T</em><sub>3</sub> - <em>T</em><sub>2</sub>).</p>
</div>
<p>Those sources that have passed a number of sanity checks are declared <em>selectable</em>. From the selectable population the statistics are used by the select algorithm to determine a number of <em>truechimers</em> according to correctness principles. From the truechimer population a number of <em>survivors</em> are determined on the basis of statistical principles. One of the survivors is declared the <em>system peer</em> and the system statistics  inherited from it. The combine algorithm computes a weighted average of the peer offset and jitter to produce the final values used by the clock discipline algorithm to adjust the system clock time and frequency.</p>
<p> When started, the program requires several measurements sufficient data fro these a algorithms to work properly before setting the clock. As the default poll interval is 64 s, it can take several minutes to set the clock. The time can be reduced using the <tt>iburst</tt> option on the <a href="confopt.html">Server Options</a> page. For additional details about the clock filter, select, cluster and combine algorithms see the Architecture Briefing on the NTP Project Page.</p>
<h4>How Statistics are Determined</h4>
<p>Each source is characterized by the  offset and  delay measured by the on-wire protocol and the  dispersion and jitter calculated by the clock filter algorithm of the peer process. Each time an NTP packet is received from a source, the dispersion is initialized by the sum of the precisions of the server and client. The offset, delay and dispersion  values are inserted as the youngest stage of  an 8-stage shift register, thus discarding the oldest stage. Subsequently, the dispersion in each stage is increased at a fixed rate of 15 <font face="symbol">m</font>s/s, representing the worst case error due to skew between the server and client clocks.  The clock filter algorithm in each peer process selects the stage with the lowest delay, which generally represents the most accurate values, and the associated offset and delay   values become the peer variables of the same name. The peer dispersion continues to grow at the same  rate as the register dispersion. The peer dispersion  is determined as a weighted average of the dispersion samples in the shift register. Finally, the peer jitter is determined as the root-mean-square (RMS) average of all the offset samples in the shift register relative to the selected sample. </p>
<p> The clock filter algorithm continues to process packets in this way until the source is no longer reachable. In this case the algorithm inserts dummy samples with  &quot;infinite&quot; dispersion are inserted in the shift register, thus displacing old samples.</p>
<p>The composition of  the survivor population and the system peer selection is redetermined as each update from each server is received. The system variables are copied from the  peer variables of the same name and the system stratum set one greater than the system peer stratum. Like  peer dispersion, the system dispersion increases at the same rate so, even if all sources have become unreachable, the daemon appears to upstratum clients at ever increasing dispersion.</p>
<h4>Reachability and Selection Criteria</h4>
<p>Of interest in this discussion is how an NTP client determines if a server is reachable and suitable as a source of synchronization. Reachability is determined by an 8-bit shift register, which is shifted left by one bit as each poll message is sent, with zero replacing the vacated rightmost bit. Each time an update is received the rightmost bit is set. The source is considered reachable if any bit is set in the register; otherwise, it is considered unreachable. The peer dispersion is used as a filter to determine whether a source is usable or not.  If the server is unreachable or the dispersion exceeds the select threshold threshold (1.5 s by default),  it is not  selectable to synchronize the system clock.</p>
<p>The quality of time service is determined by a quantity called the <em>synchronization distance.</em> It is  computed as one-half the <em>root delay</em> to the primary source of time; i.e., the primary reference clock, plus the <em>root dispersion</em>.   The root root delay and root dispersion are included in the NTP packet header. The client adds the current system peer delay and dispersion to the corresponding root values and saves them in its own system variables which are passed on to dependent clients.   Like peer dispersion, the  root dispersion increases at the same rate.</p>
<p>Although it might seem counterintuitive, a cardinal rule in the selection processes is, once a sample has been selected by the clock filter algorithm, that sample and any older samples are no longer selectable. This applies also to the select algorithm. Once the peer variables for a source have been selected, older variables of the same or other sources are no longer selectable. This means that not every sample can be used to update the peer variables and up to seven samples can be ignored between selected samples. This fact has been carefully considered in the discipline algorithm design with due consideration of the feedback loop delay and minimum sampling rate. In engineering terms, even if only one sample in eight survives, the resulting sample rate is twice the Nyquist rate at any time constant and poll interval.</p>
<h4>Clock Discipline Algorithm</h4>
<p>At the heart of the NTP host is the clock discipline algorithm, which is best described as a hybrid phase/frequency-lock feedback loop. In the NTP reference implementation, it is an intricately crafted algorithm that automatically  adapts  for optimum performance while  minimizing network overhead. Its response  is determined by  the <em>time constant</em>, which results in a &quot;stiffness&quot; depending on the   jitter  of the available sources and the stability of the system clock oscillator. The  time constant is also used as the poll interval  by the poll processes. However, in  NTP symmetric mode, each   peer manages its own poll interval and the two  might not be the same. In such cases either peer uses the minimum of its own poll interval and that of the other peer, which is included in the NTP  packet header.</p>
<p>It is important to understand how the dynamics of the discipline are affected by the poll interval. At an interval of 64 s and a step change of 100 ms, the time response crosses zero in about 50 minutes and overshoots about 7 ms, as per design. However, the step correction causes a temporary frequency  change of about 5 PPM, which is slowly corrected within a few hours. The result is that the overshoot slowly subsides over the that interval. This is an intrinsic feature of a discipline loop that can minimize both time and frequency offset.</p>
<p>Since the discipline loop is linear, the response with different step sizes and poll intervals has the characteristic, but scaled differently in amplitude and time. The response scales exactly with step amplitude, so that the response to  a 10-ms step has the same characteristic, but with amplitude one-tenth that with the 100-ms step. The response scales exactly with poll interval, so at a poll interval of 8 s the time response is the same as at 64 s, but at a time scale one-eighth that at 64 s.</p>
<p>In the NTP specification and reference implementation, poll intervals are  expressed as exponents of 2; thus, a poll exponent of 6 represents an actual poll interval; of 64 s. The clock discipline time constant is also expressed in powers of 2 and, with proper scaling, the two have the same value. Thus, a change in one corresponds to the same change in the other.</p>
<p> The optimum time constant, and thus the poll interval, depends on the network time jitter and the clock oscillator frequency wander. Errors due to jitter decrease as the time constant increases, while errors due to wander decrease as the time constant decreases. The two error characteristics intersect at a point called the Allan intercept, which represents the ideal time constant. With a compromise Allan intercept of 2000 s, the optimum poll interval is about 64 s, which corresponds to a poll exponent of 6.</p>
<p> The poll interval is managed by a heuristic algorithm developed over several years of experimentation. It depends on an exponentially weighted  average of clock offset differences, called the clock jitter, and a jiggle counter, which is initially set to zero.  When a clock update is received and the offset exceeds the clock jitter by a factor of 4,   the jiggle counter is increased by the poll exponent; otherwise, it is decreased by twice the poll exponent. If  the jiggle counter is greater than an arbitrary threshold of 30,  the poll exponent. if jiggle counter exceed an arbitrary threshold of 30, it is reset to zero and the poll exponent increased by 1.  If the jiggle counter is less than -30, it is set to zero and the  poll exponent  decreased by 1. In effect, the algorithm has a relatively slow reaction to good news, but a relatively fast reaction to bad news.</p>
<p>The optimum time constant, and thus the poll exponent, depends on the network time jitter and the clock oscillator frequency wander. Errors due to jitter decrease as the time constant increases, while errors due to wander decrease as the time constant decreases. The two error characteristics intersect at a point called the Allan intercept, which represents the ideal time constant. With a compromise Allan intercept of 2000 s, the optimum poll interval is about 64 s, which corresponds to a poll exponent of 6.</p>
