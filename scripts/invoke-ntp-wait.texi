@code{ntp-wait}
will send at most
@kbd{num-tries}
queries to
@code{ntpd(8)},
sleeping for
@kbd{secs-between-tries}
after each status return that says
@code{ntpd(8)}
has not yet produced a synchronized and stable system clock.

@code{ntp-wait}
will do this quietly, unless the
@code{-v}
flag is provided.

This section was generated by @strong{AutoGen},
using the @code{agtexi-cmd} template and the option descriptions for the @code{ntp-wait} program.

@node ntp-wait usage
@subsection ntp-wait help/usage (@option{--help})
@cindex ntp-wait help

This is the automatically generated usage text for ntp-wait.

The text printed is the same whether selected with the @code{help} option
(@option{--help}) or the @code{more-help} option (@option{--more-help}).  @code{more-help} will print
the usage text by passing it through a pager program.
@code{more-help} is disabled on platforms without a working
@code{fork(2)} function.  The @code{PAGER} environment variable is
used to select the program, defaulting to @file{more}.  Both will exit
with a status code of 0.

@example
/backroom/snaps/ntp-dev/A.snap/scripts/ntp-wait version [unknown] calling Getopt::Std::getopts (version 1.05 [paranoid]),
running under Perl version 5.8.8.

Usage: ntp-wait [-OPTIONS [-MORE_OPTIONS]] [--] [PROGRAM_ARG1 ...]

The following single-character options are accepted:
        With arguments: -n -s
        Boolean (without arguments): -v

Options may be merged together.  -- stops processing of options.
Space is not required between options and their arguments.
  [Now continuing due to backward compatibility and excessive paranoia.
   See ``perldoc Getopt::Std'' about $Getopt::Std::STANDARD_HELP_VERSION.]

@node ntp-wait 
@subsection  option (-n)
@cindex ntp-wait-

This is the ``number of times to check ntpd'' option.
This option takes an argument number @file{num-tries}.
The maximum number of times we will check ntpd to see if it
has been able to synchronize and stabilize the system clock.
@node ntp-wait 
@subsection  option (-s)
@cindex ntp-wait-

This is the ``how long to sleep between tries'' option.
This option takes an argument number @file{secs-between-tries}.
We will sleep for @file{secs-between-tries} after each query of ntpd
that returns "the time is not yet stable".
@node ntp-wait 
@subsection  option (-v)
@cindex ntp-wait-

This is the ``be verbose'' option.
By default, ntp-wait is silent.  With this option, ntp-wait
will provide status information.


@node ntp-wait config
@subsection presetting/configuring ntp-wait

Any option that is not marked as @i{not presettable} may be preset by
loading values from environment variables named @code{NTP-WAIT} and @code{NTP-WAIT_<OPTION_NAME>}.  @code{<OPTION_NAME>} must be one of
the options listed above in upper case and segmented with underscores.
The @code{NTP-WAIT} variable will be tokenized and parsed like
the command line.  The remaining variables are tested for existence and their
values are treated like option arguments.


The command line options relating to configuration and/or usage help are:

@subsubheading version (-)

Print the program version to standard out, optionally with licensing
information, then exit 0.  The optional argument specifies how much licensing
detail to provide.  The default is to print just the version.  The licensing infomation may be selected with an option argument.  Only the
first letter of the argument is examined:

@table @samp
@item version
Only print the version.  This is the default.
@item copyright
Name the copyright usage licensing terms.
@item verbose
Print the full copyright usage licensing terms.
@end table

@node ntp-wait exit status
@subsection ntp-wait exit status

One of the following exit values will be returned:
@table @samp
@item 0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)
Successful program execution.
@item 1 (EXIT_FAILURE)
The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
@end table
