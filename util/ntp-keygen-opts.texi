provided.  The group name, if specified using -i/--ident or
using -s/--subject-name following an '@' character, is also a
part of the self-signed host certificate's subject and issuer
names in the form host@group and should match the 'crypto ident'

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must be compiled in by defining @code{AUTOKEY} during the compilation.
@end itemize

Set the Autokey host name, and optionally, group name specified
following an '@' character.  The host name is used in the file
name of generated host and signing certificates, without the
group name.  The host name, and if provided, group name are used
in host@group form for the host certificate's subject and issuer
fields.  Specifying '-s @group' is allowed, and results in
leaving the host name unchanged while appending @group to the
subject and issuer fields, as with -i group.  The group name, or
if not provided, the host name are also used in the file names
of IFF, GQ, and MV client parameter files.

@node ntp-keygen trusted-cert

This is the ``trusted certificate (tc scheme)'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet

a non-trusted certificate.
